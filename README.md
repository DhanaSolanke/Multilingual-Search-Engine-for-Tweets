# Multilingual-Search-Engine
The project's aim is to gain experience of building an end-to-end IR solution which provides
wide-range of knowledge about a particular topic, including relevant tweets and analysis
results. We started with collecting twitter data based on social issues( social unrest, politics,
environment & crime) across five different cities (NYC, Mexico city, Paris, New Delhi &
Bangkok). The language of the tweets also ranges in these 5 city specific languages. Then we
created the BM25 Solr schema and indexed the corpus of tweets. We improved the IR System
Performance using query parsing and various other query boosting techniques. Post that, we
created a Web stack which would display the query results along with analytics. Finally We
performed Time series analysis, Comparison across the cities, Sentiment analysis and Faceted
search to build a solution that provides insight related to social conversations on important
societal issues.
